\chapter{Problem}

In todayâ€™s digital landscape, real-time communication platforms like Discord and Slack are essential for both enterprise and community collaboration. However, existing solutions often face scalability issues, security vulnerabilities, and limited cloud-native integration. Enterprises require a highly available, secure, and scalable communication system that supports text, voice, and video while ensuring compliance with security best practices (e.g., OWASP, GDPR) and seamless DevOps integration.

CloudCord addresses these challenges by leveraging microservices, cloud-native deployment, and real-time data processing to create a reliable, secure, and scalable communication platform tailored for enterprise use.


\chapter{Opportunity}

With the growing demand for secure, scalable, and cloud-native communication platforms, there is an opportunity to build a modern alternative that integrates real-time messaging, voice, and video while ensuring enterprise-level security, compliance, and DevOps automation.

CloudCord offers a flexible, self-hosted, and cloud-integrated solution that can scale dynamically, meet strict security standards (e.g., OWASP, GDPR), and provide high availability through microservices and Kubernetes. By focusing on cloud-native best practices, distributed architecture, and CI/CD automation, CloudCord positions itself as an enterprise-ready alternative to existing platforms, catering to both businesses and communities.


\chapter{Research questions}

\section{Main question}

How can a cloud-native, microservices-based Discord-like platform be designed and implemented to ensure scalability, security, and real-time performance for enterprise use?

\section{Sub-Questions}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Scalability:} What architectural patterns and cloud-native technologies can be used to ensure high availability and scalability in a microservices-based platform?

\item \textbf{DevOps:} How can CI/CD, infrastructure as code, and monitoring ensure reliable deployment, scalability and maintainability for CloudCord?

\item \textbf{Cloud Native:} How can CloudCord use cloud-native technologies to improve scalability, reliability, and cost efficiency?

\item \textbf{Security:} How can CloudCord integrate security best practices, such as authentication, encryption, and OWASP Top 10 mitigation, to protect user data and minimize vulnerabilities?

\item \textbf{Distributed Data:} How can CloudCord securely handle and store data while ensuring GDPR compliance and protecting sensitive information?
